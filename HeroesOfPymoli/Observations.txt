Three Observable Trends Based On Data:

1. 20 to 24 year olds are, by 248, the largest age range for the game.

2. There are 403 more male than female players, and 392 more male players than female and other / undisclosed players.

3. There are only 484 players, and an income of $2,379.77 from 179 purchases, which is only 37% of the player base buying items. Some of those buyers buy frequently which means less than 37% of the player base buys items. Considering the cost to run game servers the company should consider marketing promotions to players or expanding the player base to increase revenue - unless the game is run by one person on a home server internet connection, in which case he's doing pretty okay!
