# Pandas Challenge

This is an assignment I completed for the [UCSD Extension Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.extension.ucsd.edu/). This assignment ensured my ability to use the Pandas library to create dataframes, process data, and make it presentable within Jupyter Notebook. This introduction to Pandas was enjoyable because I felt that I could understand the syntax quickly and learn from the [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html).

The goal of this challenge is to sort through a fictitonal database of players and their purchases for the game Heroes of Pymoli to identify purchasing trends based on age and gender. With a larger dataset this use of Pandas would be able to analyze sales trends and help prepare for events within Heroes of Pymoli.

## Purchasing Analysis

The purchasing analysis looks at the number of unique items purchased by players, the average purchase price of an item, the total number of purchases, and the total revenue from these purchases. This KPI is a quick way to get a look at revenue and could be applied to a specific time period or in-game event to see how the purchasing analysis is affected. 

The provided data allowed me to break down the purchasing analysis into different categories, such as based on gender, purchase value, and age demographics.
